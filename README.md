## Introduction

Image Encryption using AES is a C++ program designed to encrypt images using both sequential and parallel versions of the AES encryption algorithm.
This project was designed to apply AES encryption to a public image dataset in order demonstrate the difference between sequential encryption and parallel encryption.
Furthermore, the project utilizes AI tools to generate the sequential version of the program from which the basic structure of the parallel encryption algorithm is formed.

Key aspects of this project include:
- Applying AES encryption to a public image dataset
- Demonstrating the complexity of image encryption
- Utilizes AI tools for generating the sequential program version
- Applies parallelism to the encryption algorithm to demonstrates the difference in performance between parallel and sequential encryption.
